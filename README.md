# Semantic Search with Milvus and VectorStore

This project demonstrates how to perform semantic search using Milvus for vector storage, with the ability to retrieve relevant documents based on a query.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `milvus` library (for Milvus integration)
- `llama_index` library (for document indexing and retrieval)
- `AutoMergingRetriever` for retrieving and merging relevant results
- Milvus server running at the specified URI

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install the necessary packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install milvus llama_index
   ```

2. **Milvus Server**:
   - Ensure that your Milvus server is running. In this case, the server URI is set to `"http://ip:19530"`. Replace `ip` with the actual IP address of the Milvus server.

3. **VectorStore Setup**:
   - This code utilizes `MilvusVectorStore` to store and retrieve vectors (representing documents). The vector dimension is set to 1024, but it should match the output of your embedding model.

## Code Explanation

1. **Create a VectorStore**:
   This part sets up a MilvusVectorStore with the required configuration:

   ```python
   vector_store = MilvusVectorStore(
       uri="http://ip:19530",
       dim=1024,
       collection_name="collection_name",
       overwrite=False
   )
   ```

   - `uri`: The URI for connecting to the Milvus server.
   - `dim`: The dimension of the vectors.
   - `collection_name`: The collection name where the vectors will be stored.
   - `overwrite`: Whether to overwrite an existing collection.

2. **Storage Context**:
   The `StorageContext` is created, which connects the vector store to the document processing pipeline:

   ```python
   storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(
       vector_store=vector_store,  # Replace with your directory
   )
   ```

3. **Index Creation**:
   The `VectorStoreIndex` is created using the documents and the storage context:

   ```python
   index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
       documents=documents,
       storage_context=storage_context
   )
   ```

4. **Retriever Setup**:
   The `base_retriever` retrieves documents from the index based on the top-k similarity search:

   ```python
   base_retriever = index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=10)
   ```

   The `AutoMergingRetriever` is then used to merge retrieved results with the original storage context for improved performance:

   ```python
   retriever = AutoMergingRetriever(base_retriever, storage_context, verbose=True)
   ```

5. **Query Execution**:
   The retriever is used to perform a semantic search for the query `"who is kunal gawande"`:

   ```python
   nodes = retriever.retrieve("who is kunal gawande")
   context_str = "\n\n".join([n.node.get_content() for n in nodes])
   ```

   The `context_str` contains the content of the retrieved nodes.

## Example Output

For the query `"who is kunal gawande"`, the output may look like:

```
Node 1 content: Kunal Gawande is a software engineer...
Node 2 content: Kunal Gawande is a researcher working on AI...
```

This retrieved content can be further used for generating answers, making recommendations, or any other purpose.
